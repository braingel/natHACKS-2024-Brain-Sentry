# Auralis: Speech-Based Detection of Cognitive Decline
Auralis—Detect the decline, while there’s still time. This project was developed at NatHACKS 2024 at The University of Alberta.

- Auralis is an innovative solution designed to detect early signs of dementia by analysing cognitive decline in real-time speech. Dementia manifests through shared symptoms such as _slower speech, long pauses, verbal fillers, and declined vocabulary_. Early detection of these symptoms is key to timely medical intervention enabling people with dementia and their families to plan, find support, and prioritise what truly matters.

- We used [_DementiaNet_](https://github.com/shreyasgite/dementianet), an open-source longitudinal dataset of audio recordings from famous actors with and without dementia. These recordings include speech patterns captured over time, allowing our machine-learning model to differentiate between healthy ageing and early cognitive decline.

- Our  web application enables users to record 30-second to 1-minute audio clips for analysis, integrating into regular health routines. The model processes these recordings to identify dementia-related speech patterns for early detection.
